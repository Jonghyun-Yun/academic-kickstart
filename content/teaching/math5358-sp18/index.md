Welcome to the Regression Analysis course!

This course introduces regression
models, which relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest. These
models are the most important statistical technique that a data scientist needs
to master.

You will learn the theory behind regression models and, through real-world
examples, learn to fit, diagnose, and utilize regression models to examine the
relationship between predictors and a continuous or discrete outcome, using the
statistical software R. You will learn modern approaches on model selection and
novel uses of regression models.

Before beginning the class make sure that you have the following:

-   A basic understanding of linear algebra and calculus.
-   A basic understanding of statistical inference.
-   Basic knowledge of the R programming language. This is not required, but a big plus.
