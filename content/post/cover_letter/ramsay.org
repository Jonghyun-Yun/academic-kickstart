* To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow,
# NOTE: Your letter is the first non-special heading.  The title of
# this heading may used as an opening.

Your false king is dead, bastard. He and all his host were smashed in seven days
of battle. I have his magic sword. Tell his red whore.

Your false king's friends are dead. Their heads upon the walls of Winterfell.
Come see them, bastard. Your false king lied, and so did you. You told the world
you burned the King-Beyond-the-Wall. Instead you sent him to Winterfell to steal
my bride from me.

I will have my bride back. If you want Mance Rayder back, come and get him. I
have him in a cage for all the north to see, proof of your lies. The cage is
cold, but I have made him a warm cloak from the skins of the six whores who came
with him to Winterfell.

I want my bride back. I want the false king's queen. I want his daughter and his
red witch. I want this wildling princess. I want his little prince, the wildling
babe. And I want my Reek. Send them to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you
or your black crows. Keep them from me, and I will cut out your bastard's heart
and eat it.
