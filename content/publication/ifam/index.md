   abstract = "This study presents a random shape aggregate model by establishing a functional mixture model for images of aggregate shapes. The mesoscale simulation to consider heterogeneous properties concrete is the highly cost- and time-effective method to predict the mechanical behavior of the concrete. Due to the significance of the design of the mesoscale concrete model, the shape of the aggregate is the most important parameter to obtain a reliable simulation result. We propose image analysis and functional data clustering for random shape aggregate models (IFAM). This novel technique learns the morphological characteristics of aggregates using images of real aggregates as inputs. IFAM provides random aggregates across a broad range of heterogeneous shapes using samples drawn from the estimated functional mixture model as outputs. Our learning algorithm is fully automated and allows flexible learning of the complex characteristics. Therefore, unlike similar studies, IFAM does not require users to perform time-consuming tuning on their model to provide realistic aggregate morphology. Using comparative studies, we demonstrate the random aggregate structures constructed by IFAM achieve close similarities to real aggregates in an inhomogeneous concrete medium. Thanks to our fully data-driven method, users can choose their own libraries of real aggregates for the training of the model and generate random aggregates with high similarities to the target libraries."
